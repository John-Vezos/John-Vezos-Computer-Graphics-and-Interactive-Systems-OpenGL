# Computer Graphics and Interactive Systems OpenGL
## This is a mini game in OpenGL
###### Initialize a world with cubes, and there you can move in 4 ways, destroy cubes and add cubes.
###### You can not destroy cubes from level 1 and you can climb 1 cube per move.
###### Avatar.cpp is the same project but you move a small avatar and camera is above your head.
